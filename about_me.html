                <p><b>Hi there!</b> My name is Jamie Lee. I am a rising second-year Masters student at the University of Michigan School of Information (expected to graduate in May 2022). I am currently pursuing my Masters of Science in Information, with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction and UX Research and Design. Throughout my graduate studies, I hope to not only explore how technology can affirm social, political, and cultural norms, but also how it can be used to challenge existing beliefs and spark reflection on the world we live in. This summer, I will be interning at <a href="https://www.levistrauss.com/work-with-us/u-s-internships-at-levi-strauss-co/" target="_blank">Levi Strauss & Co.</a>, conducting user research on the firm's omnichannel consumer platforms and working to create frictionless shopping experiences.</p>
                <p>Prior to pursuing my graduate degree, I worked as a data engineer for two years at J.P. Morgan Chase, where I led various data migration and data cleansing projects to support advanced analytical work. In addition to my full-time role, I served as the Software Engineering Program Committee Lead for Manhattan, working to build community among entry-level technologists and create networking and learning opportunities with firmwide leaders. Having joined the firm through a diversity initiative called <a href="https://careers.jpmorgan.com/us/en/students/programs/tech-connect?search=&tags=location__Americas__UnitedStatesofAmerica" target="_blank">Tech Connect</a>, I was also actively involved in efforts to recruit underrepresented and non-traditional talent, making the field of technology more accessible to those of all backgrounds and identities.</p>
                <p>I received my B.A. in Cognitive Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2018.</p>
